          I've been a friend for a very long time at least longer than 96hrs and
          i think i know a bit of you i don't want to lose to any other person,
          the part my heart yearns for on daily basis, hoping and waiting
          patiently to spend the rest of his life with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I legit want to bring in my things into your space, change couple
          things, Love you like i haven't loved anyone, and love you like no one
          has ever done.
        </p>
        <p>
          For real i dont want to catch cruise, i want a mad ass lifetime
          something, it's been happening like a dream, that's why i have delayed
          till now to actually give myself time to wake up but it's reality and
          i am glad, though i was clearly told not to catch feelings, i broke
          the rule, well rules are meant to be broken and uhm! i think i want
          this broken rule to lead to some super-duper hit track,like for real
          now i'm kinda clear this thingie isn't infatuation and can boldly ask
          you to be my Woman!
        </p>
        <p>
          Would you be my lover?, Oh i didn't add a <strong>NO</strong> button,
          yeah! i don't even want you to be tempted to choose it, yeah i love
          you that much .
